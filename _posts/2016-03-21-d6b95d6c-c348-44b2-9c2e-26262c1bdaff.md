_**HollyHood Productions**_

is a movement. One that is grounded in the belief that despite all the evidence to the contrary, a team of underprivileged but focused Latino filmmakers from the Bronx can rise up and flourish in a market where good films are rewarded for their originality, their characters, and their authenticity.

We understand that film is a collection of all art forms, and when executed with respect for each craft, it has the ability to make us hope and dream, laugh and cry, and sometimes, in those rare and magical times, it makes us do so all at once.

We use the word "Hood" not only as a play on words in regards to our Tinseltown aspirations, but as a reminder of where we come from. The neighborhoods and projects we grew up in, the struggle it took to get us where we are today. We use it as a reminder of the struggle we must endure to get to where we are going tomorrow.

We consider ourselves fortunate to be surrounded with such an immense wealth of talent both inside the New York City area and beyond - actors, make-up artists, directors of photography, sound engineers, and musicians, all of whom share the same love of film that propels us in the face of adversity to push forward, knowing that the lessons learned will make us better equipped, not only as professionals, but as human beings.

We are grateful to anyone who has watched and supported our films and who has encouraged us to follow our passions. It is because of them that we dream, that we hope, and most importantly that we believe!

As we channel this into our films, we hope it translates into what you see on screen, so that every film and every scene is a thank you in and of itself. We promise that you will never see anything less than our best, and at times, even if you do not agree with our views, we hope that our films will at least help you to understand them, where we come from, and who we are.

**HollyHood**

Forever.

Until then - FADE OUT.
